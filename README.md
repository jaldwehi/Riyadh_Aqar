# Riyadh Villa Price Prediction — ML & FastAPI Project
Project Overview

This project aims to predict villa prices in Riyadh based on a variety of property-related features.
We chose Riyadh because it is a large and diverse real estate market, which provides rich data and variation across neighborhoods.

The main goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the price for any property entered by the user through a FastAPI interface.
